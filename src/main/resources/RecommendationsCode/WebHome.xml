  <content>== Recommendations Application ==

The Recommendations Application add the ability to recommend content to XWiki users, by listing pages that could be interesting for them in a panel.
There are 2 types of recommendations in the extension : 
* User-based recommendations : Create links between pages based on the users' histories. Recommendations will then depend on what other users have visited or edited in the wiki.
* Content-based recommendations : The engine needs to know the page the user is currently reading and it will recommend pages with a similar content or metadata (most frequent words of the page, title, tags, author and space).

You can find documentation to know how to configure the extension [[here&gt;&gt;http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/edit/Extension/RecommendationsApplication]].
